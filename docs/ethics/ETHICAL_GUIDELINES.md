# Ethical Guidelines for Botnet Research

## ‚öñÔ∏è Fundamental Principles

This project operates under strict ethical guidelines based on the **Menlo Report** principles for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) research. All participants must adhere to these principles without exception.

### 1. Respect for Persons
- **Informed Consent**: All research participants must be fully informed about the nature, scope, and potential risks of the research
- **Privacy Protection**: Personal data and privacy must be protected at all times
- **Autonomy**: Individuals must have the right to withdraw from research participation

### 2. Beneficence
- **Maximize Benefits**: Research must contribute positively to cybersecurity knowledge and defensive capabilities
- **Minimize Harm**: All activities must be designed to prevent unintended harm to individuals or systems
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk analysis must be conducted before any research activities

### 3. Justice
- **Fair Distribution**: Benefits and burdens of research must be distributed fairly
- **Non-Discrimination**: Research must not target or discriminate against specific groups
- **Accessibility**: Research findings should benefit the broader cybersecurity community

### 4. Respect for Law and Public Interest
- **Legal Compliance**: All activities must comply with applicable local, national, and international laws
- **Public Good**: Research must serve the public interest and cybersecurity community
- **Transparency**: Research methods and findings should be openly shared (within security constraints)
