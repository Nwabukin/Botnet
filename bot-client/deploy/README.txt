- Unauthorized deployment on non-owned systems is strictly prohibited
- Users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Operation must be limited to authorized, controlled environments

PACKAGE CONTENTS:
- botnet-client[.exe]  : Main executable
- README.txt          : This file
- LICENSE.txt         : License and legal information

DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. PREREQUISITES:
   - Ensure you have legal authorization to run this software
   - Verify the target system is owned/authorized by you
   - Confirm operation in an isolated, controlled environment

2. BASIC DEPLOYMENT:
   - Copy the executable to target system
   - Configure C2 server endpoint (see configuration section)
   - Run with appropriate permissions

3. CONFIGURATION:
   The client can be configured via:
   - Command line arguments
   - Configuration file (config.json)
   - Environment variables

   Example configuration:
   {
     "c2_server": "https://your-c2-server.local:8443",
     "client_id": "research-client-001",
     "encryption_key": "your-encryption-key",
     "communication_interval": 60,
     "research_mode": true
   }

4. COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
   --config <file>       : Specify configuration file
   --c2-server <url>     : C2 server URL
   --client-id <id>      : Unique client identifier
   --research-mode       : Enable research mode with safety limits
   --help                : Show help information

5. RESEARCH MODE:
   When --research-mode is enabled:
   - All activities are logged for analysis
   - Safety limits prevent unintended harm
   - Automatic kill switches are active
   - Data exfiltration is simulated, not real

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES:

Windows:
- May require administrator privileges for certain features
- Windows Defender may flag as potentially unwanted
- Use PowerShell for advanced configuration

Linux:
- Requires appropriate permissions for system-level features
- Consider running in container for additional isolation
- Check firewall settings for C2 communication

macOS:
- May require System Integrity Protection (SIP) considerations
- Notarization bypassed for research builds
- Use Terminal for command-line operation

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- This software implements advanced evasion techniques
- Running outside controlled environments poses security risks
- Monitor all network communications during research
- Implement proper containment and cleanup procedures

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Connection Issues:
- Verify C2 server is running and accessible
- Check firewall and network settings
- Validate SSL certificates if using HTTPS

Permission Errors:
- Run with appropriate system privileges
- Check file and directory permissions
- Verify user account has necessary rights

Research Data:
- All research activities are logged to ./research_logs/
- Network traffic patterns documented in ./traffic_analysis/
- System changes tracked in ./system_changes.log

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:
- Use Ctrl+C or SIGTERM to gracefully shutdown
- Emergency kill switch: send SIGUSR1 signal
- Remote kill command: send "EMERGENCY_STOP" via C2
- Force cleanup: run with --cleanup-only flag

SUPPORT:
For research support and ethical guidance:
- Review the main project documentation
- Consult institutional review board if applicable
- Contact project maintainers for technical issues

Remember: With great power comes great responsibility.
Use this knowledge to defend, not to attack.
